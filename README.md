# Todo
✓ Have Elm work with Webpack

✓ Have Elm navigate between 2 pages and take parameters

✓ Integrate TailwindCSS in the build process

✓ Make nicer HTML

✓ Have Elm read rudimentary Flags

Have a mechanism to install ports

Demonstrate the port installation mechanism works
  

# VSCode settings
Development experience with VSCode seems to be good. Use the _elm tooling_ plugin that has superseded the old _elm_ plugin. Make sure to enable _format on save_ in _Settings->Text Editor->Formatting_.

# Depencies on Manjaro Linux

## NodeJS
```
sudo pamac install nodejs
```
## Elm
Follow the guide provided here: [Linux Installation Readme](https://github.com/elm/compiler/blob/master/installers/linux/README.md)

# Ports
There are a lot of initiatives for making working with _ports_ easier in Elm. Unfortunately all of them have some significant drawbacks. There is a [proposal](https://github.com/supermario/elm-pkg-js/blob/master/proposal.md) out on GitHub that details an alternative. It would be nice to implement one and use it here.
